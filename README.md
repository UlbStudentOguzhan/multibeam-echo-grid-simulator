# multibeam-echo-grid-simulator
This repository contains the simulation code (python) for reproducing the results of the accepted paper "Echo grid integration: A novel method for preprocessing multibeam water column data to quantify underwater gas bubble emissions." by Urban et. al. 2023 (Accepted) 

The program simulates multibeam water column images for virtual surveys over individual targets or target clouds and allows for testing the effects of different echo grid integration methods. (See Urban et. al 2023 for more details)
